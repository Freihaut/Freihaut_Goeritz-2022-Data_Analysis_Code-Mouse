### General Data Analysis Code and Datasets

This folder contains all general analysis code as well as specified datasets for further analysis.

Specifically, this folder contains:

- Python code to get descriptive stats about the dataset as well as descriptive stats about the mouse-task data
and the free-mouse data [Descriptive_Statistics.py]
- Python code to get infos from the results and create result tables [Paper_Results_Tables.py]
- Python code to run machine learning analysis with the dataset of Banholzer et al. (2021) [Emotional_State_Prediction_BanholzerEtAl.py]
- R code to compare the feature calculation procedure used in this study with the mouse-feature calculation procedure
of the mousetrap package [MouseTrap_Feature_Validation.R]
- Sample dataset to calculate the mouse features using the mousetrap R-package as well as to compare the feature
calculation procedure to the feature calculation procedure used in the present study [Mousetrap_Validation_Data.json]
- Dataset of the longitudinal mouse study by Banholzer et al. (2021). You can find the research paper [here](https://doi.org/10.2196/27121) and the
a link to their repository with data analysis code and the dataset [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HE3F2) [Data_Banholzer_et_al.csv]
- The results of the machine learning analysis [Banholzer_ML_Analysis_results.p]
- A dataset that contains sociodemographic infos about the dataset for the descriptive stats analysis
