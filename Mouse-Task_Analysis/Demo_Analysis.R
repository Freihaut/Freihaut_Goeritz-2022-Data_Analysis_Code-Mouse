# Questions:
# 1. Model Building: What models to build and compare? (Null Model, Baseline
#   Model with controls, Fixed Effect Model, Random Effect Model)
# 2. Controls: How to handle control variables? Does it make sense to include them in the
#   analysis (especially zoom, height, width - additional are age, hand, sex,
#   order number)
# 3. Model performance: What to report about the models to answer the research 
#   question? (RÂ²,effect coefficients, AIC, explained state/trait variance?)
# 4. Data preprocessing: Any suggestions on how to handle the raw data, e.g 
#   transformation, visualization?
